# CNN Research
Senior Research Spring 2020
Author @Corey Domingos 

This purpose of this research assignment is to highlight which
activation function works best for a given dataset. The two data sets 
that are going to be implemented are the MNIST & FASHION_MNIST
datasets. Both of these datasets are offered through Tensorflow
and allow for easy integration with Python. The two activation functions 
that will be tested on are the Sigmoid & Relu functions due to their 
popularity within the data science community. A comparision to show which
function works best for the given dataset will be highlighted through 
error rate percentages.
